# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Retries Double-Counted** ([#17](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/17))
  - Test retries no longer inflate test counts (e.g., 509 tests showing as 530)
  - Only the final attempt for each test is counted
  - Uses Playwright's `test.outcome()` to properly identify flaky tests

- **Expected Failures Incorrectly Reported** ([#16](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/16))
  - Tests marked with `test.fail()` that actually fail are now counted as passed (expected behavior)
  - Uses Playwright's `expectedStatus` to determine expected outcomes
  - Expected failures are excluded from failure clustering

### Added

- **Improved Tag Extraction** ([#15](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/15))
  - Tags now extracted from `test.tags` property (Playwright's built-in collection)
  - Falls back to annotations and title parsing for backwards compatibility
  - Tags are visible in the test cards and sidebar filters

- **Better Console Output** ([#15](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/15))
  - Report path now includes helpful commands to open the report
  - Shows `npx playwright show-report` and `open` commands

- **Custom Attachments Support** ([#15](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/15))
  - Attachments added via `testInfo.attach()` are now collected and displayed
  - Custom attachments appear in test details with appropriate icons

- **Inline Trace Viewer** ([#13](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/13))
  - View Playwright traces directly in the dashboard without CLI commands
  - Full-featured viewer with timeline, actions, snapshots, console, and network tabs
  - Includes JSZip for client-side trace extraction
  - Fallback to CLI command when viewing from file:// protocol

- **Attachment Gallery** ([#14](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/14))
  - Gallery view displays all screenshots, videos, and traces in a grid
  - Lightbox support for screenshot viewing with keyboard navigation
  - Filter by attachment type (screenshots, videos, traces)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Google Gemini AI Support** ([#18](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/pull/18))
  - Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for Google Gemini API integration
  - Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` model for fast, cost-effective failure analysis
  - Provider priority: Anthropic Claude → OpenAI → Google Gemini
  - Comprehensive test coverage for AI analyzer (31 new tests)
  - Thanks to [@TheAntz](https://github.com/TheAntz) for this contribution!

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Timed Out Tests Now Counted as Failed** ([#12](https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/qa-sentinel/issues/12))
  - Tests with `timedOut` status are now correctly counted as failed in summary stats
  - Comparison detection for new failures and fixed tests now includes timedOut status
  - Previously, timedOut tests showed as 0 failed in stats

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Network Logs**: Zero-config extraction of network requests from Playwright trace files
  - View HTTP method, URL, status code, duration, and payload sizes
  - Expandable entries show headers, request body, and timing breakdown
  - Configurable via `enableNetworkLogs`, `networkLogExcludeAssets`, `networkLogMaxEntries`
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Filter tests by tags like `@smoke`, `@critical`
  - Tags extracted from test annotations and test titles
  - Tags displayed as badges on test cards
- **Suite-Based Filtering**: Filter by test suite from `test.describe()` blocks
  - Suite name shown in test card header
  - Hierarchical suite support

### Changed

- **Branding Update**: Renamed to "StageWright Local" with tagline "Get your test stage right."

### Fixed

- **Sidebar Stats Click**: Clicking Passed/Failed/Flaky stats now works from any view (switches to Tests view)
- **Expand/Collapse in Detail Panel**: Test cards in detail panel now expand correctly
  - Fixed event handling for cloned cards
  - Removed redundant expand icon from detail panel cards
